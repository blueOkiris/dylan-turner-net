                <p>
                    Ever since I was eight years old, I've been a maker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started with creating small video games back then and worked my way into
                    hardware and eventually circuit design. Now, I have professional experience in
                    product design and engineering, along with a degree, but I've been a tinkerer
                    for my whole life. I am full of passion, and I firmly believe you won't find
                    another person who loves related fields as much as I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have quite a lot of different interests across engineering, music,
                    linguistics, sports, writing, etc. Completing projects in any of these areas
                    require me to have an open mind, focus hard, and put in a lot of work to be
                    successful, so I put effort into everything I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion and my wide breadth of skills makes me adaptable, results-driven,
                    eager and quick to learn, and a great problem solver. Combine that with my
                    friendly personality and enjoyment of team work, and I know I can be the
                    perfect fit for any team.
